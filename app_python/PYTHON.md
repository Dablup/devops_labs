## Python Web Application

### Framework

I decided to use [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) framework. I chose exactly this one because of several reasons:
* This framework is very easy to use.
* It is flexible.
* With Flask, our project's code always consists only of what we put in it, with no unnecessary code responsible for features you donâ€™t use.
* Documentation

But nevertheless this framework has some **disadvantages** as well:
* More complicated maintenance for larger implementations
* More potential for security risks
* Higher maintenance costs for more complex systems

### Best practices

* Following style guidelines. For example, The [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) holds some great community-generated proposals.
* Usage of Virtual Environments.
* Usage of `.gitignore ` to ignore unnecessary files while committing and pushing.

### Linters for Python and Markdown

For python I used [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and [PyFlakes](https://pypi.org/project/pyflakes/). 

For markdown I used [markdownlint-cli](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli)
